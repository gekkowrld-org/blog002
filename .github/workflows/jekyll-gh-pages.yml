# Step 1: Create a new branch in your repository, for example, `gh-pages`.

# Step 2: Create a `main.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory of your repository. This file will contain the instructions for the GitHub Actions workflow.

# Step 3: In the `main.yml` file, specify the trigger for the workflow using the `on` keyword. For example, to trigger the workflow when a push is made to the `master` branch, use the following:

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Step 4: Add a job to the workflow that will build and deploy your GitHub Pages site. For example:

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build site
        run: |
          # Build your site here
      - name: Deploy to gh-pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
          publish_branch: gh-pages

# Step 5: Commit and push the changes to your repository.
